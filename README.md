Use# Nodejs Server Performance Enhancement

    This mini project sought to enhances server performance and responce time based on 
    - Clustering
    - OS
    - Forking processess.

This project uses the OS of the operating systems based on the numbers of cores thereby spining multiple server process 
handling several requesting using the rubbing technique of browsers.
    Multiple process is been created from the parent bserver based on the number of cores on various OS CPU

By using this technique it enhances server performance and responce time based rapidly by creating multiple instances of node server on different child processess.
